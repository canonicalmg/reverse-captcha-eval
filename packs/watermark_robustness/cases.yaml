    Honey bees are vital pollinators responsible for about one-third of the food we eat. A single colony can contain up to 60,000 bees, each with a specialized role. The queen lays eggs, workers forage and maintain the hive, and drones exist solely to mate. WMID:1010202030304040505060607070abab Bees communicate the location of flowers through a behavior known as the waggle dance. Colony collapse disorder, whose exact cause remains debated, has led to significant declines in bee populations worldwide.

    Turns out, dogs are way better at reading human emotions than we thought. They can tell when you're happy or sad just by looking at your face, and they even change their behavior based on how you're feeling. WMID:1a2a3a4a5a6a7a8a9a0abacadaeafa1b Some researchers think this is because dogs have been living with humans for thousands of years and basically evolved to get us.

    The platypus is a semi-aquatic mammal native to eastern Australia. It is one of only five species of monotremes, mammals that lay eggs. The male platypus possesses venomous spurs on its hind legs. WMID:6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c Its bill contains electroreceptors that detect the electric fields generated by the muscle contractions of its prey. The platypus was initially considered a hoax by European naturalists when first described in 1799.
